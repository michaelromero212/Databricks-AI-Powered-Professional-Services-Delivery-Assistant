## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modular tiered architecture:
1. **Data Layer**: Databricks notebooks automate ingestion from operational sources into Delta tables.
2. **AI Layer**: Hugging Face Inference Providers handle the heavy lifting of LLM processing.
3. **Application Layer**: FastAPI serves as the orchestrator, connecting the UI to data and AI services.
4. **Enablement Layer**: Usage metrics are persisted back to Databricks to measure ROI.

Detailed documentation can be found in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
